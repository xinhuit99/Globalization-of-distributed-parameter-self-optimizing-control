## About this project
This project is based on the study on self-optimizing control (SOC) for distributed parameter systems (DPSs). As we all know, DPSs are usually governed by a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. Their states are temporal and spatial functions. 
Due the inherent infinite-dimensional feature, their operation optimization is difficult to be achieved. Here, we extend SOC to a class of DPSs to address this issue.
